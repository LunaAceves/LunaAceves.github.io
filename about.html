    <h3>Natalie Cleveland</h3>
    <p>Hello! I'm a junior at Stony Point High School, and I'm 16 years old. I was born on July 12, 2000, and raised in texas. At stony Point I took a Computer Science class, but I plan on expanding my knowledge in other fields, such as the medical course I will be taking. I hate geometrey with a passion, but in my opinion algebra is one of the easiest classes ever, and chemestry is definetly a challenging class, but is very fun whenever we did a lab project. My sporty activity is track, and I run the 800 and 4x4, but I plan on training to qualify for the 400. I have a sister named Corinna, who will be joining me at Stony Point, two crazy dogs, and parents + stepmom. My future is not very planned, but I do hope to have a well paying job that requires CS and possible medical skills. When I grow up I would very much like to move out of Texas and away from the heat, possibly a nice place to run, with much scenery, but not far from a beach. Girls Who Code has impacted my future in the best way possible, and I'm very grateful to be in the program. We've done so much and I know that this will allow a good future for myself if I continue to practice coding and coming up with new ideas. </p>

    <p>Hi!I'm a 16-year-old senior at Stony Point High School. I was born on September 30th, 1999 in Los Angeles, California. My family moved to Texas when I was 5 and I've lived here ever since! I've never taken a Computer Science class at my High School, but I've taken engineering classes since the 7th grade. I've played the violin for 6 years and 2 years ago I made it into the top orchestra at my school. As head of notebook for my school's robotics team i've gotten our notebook to first place and second place. I love reading and I love webcomics. I love watching movies, especially really bad ones(Gods of Egypt!). I write a lot, but I tend to write things that don't connect. I'm an only child and I have two cats: Atreyu(we don't know what he is) and Valkyrie(a troublemaking tortiseshell). I like to sew but the only things I can really make are these little triangle shaped chickens.</p>

    <h5>Website Designer</h5>
    <p>Hello! I am a 18-year-old high school senior from Cedar Ridge High School, in Round Rock, TX. I was born on June 15, 1998, and moved to Round Rock, TX on 
    October 2003 at the age of 5.I went to Girls Who Code: Summer Immersion program, because I want to pursue a future in computer science/engineering. Although 
    I designed this website with Natalie and Izel, website designing isn't my only favorite part of computer science. Robotics and cryptography are also my 
    favorite parts of computer science. In the future, I want to attend a pretty good university like MIT, Carnegie Mellon, UT Austin, Rice, UC Berekely, UCLA,
    Stanford, or Cornell (and if I'm good enough, run track in Carnegie Mellon or MIT).Besides computer science, my favorite subjects in school are math and science, 
    and my favorite hobbies are running (track & field team - I compete in sprints and relays...I am training for the 400 and maybe 800), competing in math and athletic 
    (track & taekwondo) events, binge watching YouTube videos, reading the news, listening to music (Zayn!), hanging out with family and friends, and...trolling (I don't 
    internet troll...I promise)my family and friends(shout out to Kaylah Ramirez!)>:D</p>
